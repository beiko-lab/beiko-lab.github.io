Arete is an integrated bioinformatics tool built to improve the discovery and functional annotation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, especially in metagenomic or draft genome contexts. It leverages evolutionary and syntenic signals from gene neighborhoods, combined with robust machine learning techniques, to infer both known and novel AMR candidates.

Arete supports:
- AMR gene neighborhood extraction and visualization
- Feature engineering from synteny, sequence, and functional domains
- Machine learning pipelines for resistance prediction
- Export of candidate genes for downstream experimental validation

It is designed to be modular, scalable, and easy to integrate into existing AMR research workflows.
