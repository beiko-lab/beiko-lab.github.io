Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes frequently spread via horizontal gene transfer, alongside neighboring genes.
My research focuses on developing comparative genomics and machine learning approaches that integrate genomic neighborhood and gene order information. The goal is to improve the detection of hidden AMR threats—so-called “unknown unknowns” and to better understand the evolution of AMR gene neighborhoods. This work has the potential to reduce the growing burden of AMR by enabling the identification of silent resistance threats in poorly characterized organisms across the One Health Consortium.
