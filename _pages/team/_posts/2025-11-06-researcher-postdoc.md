I completed my PhD at the University of Ottawa, where I worked under the supervision of Dr. Daniel Figeys on peptide-centric human gut metaproteomics analysis. I have since continued my research on the microbiome, which is closely linked to both human health and the broader environment (including soil, marine systems, and beyond). Although large-scale microbiome research is ongoing, the field still lacks standardized measurement approaches and consistent conclusions that can effectively inform public understanding and policy development. In this context, my current research focuses on promoting consistency across microbiome studies to support the development of evidence-based policies that facilitate healthy microbiomes for both humans and ecosystems. This aligns with the core mission of the Microbiome <a href="https://www.microbiomestewardship.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stewardship Project</a>.
